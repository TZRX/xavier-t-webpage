		Interest in IT
	</h2>
	<p>
		I’ve had an interest in IT for as long as I can remember, and I believe that it mainly stemmed from my love of video games at a young age. At the moment, generally all aspects pique my interest, so I’m looking forward to seeing what specific branch will catch my eye. I have gained some experience in networking from the time I spent in national service, as I was assigned to a military unit that maintained networks for the army nationwide.

		I chose to study at RMIT for two main reasons. The first reason is that the university campus is in an ideal location for study. Following up with this reason, I intend to settle down and work in Melbourne, so I find it convenient to continue studying here. The other reason is that RMIT provided a good program for IT, and it suited my preferences and what I wanted to specialise in.

	<p>
		In my studies, I expect to learn more about the world of IT, and the different branches to specialise in. I especially look forward to expanding my knowledge on networking, as well as learning about artificial intelligence, but overall, I would like to have good general knowledge of all things IT.

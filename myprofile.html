    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.</p>
    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <p>Rational – Architects pride themselves on their minds.</p>
    <p>Informed – Few personality types are as devoted as Architects to forming rational, evidence-based opinions.</p>
    <p>Independent – For these personality types, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity.</p>
    <p>Determined – Architect personalities are ambitious and goal-oriented.</p>
    <p>Curious – Architects are open to new ideas – as long as those ideas are rational and evidence-based, that is.</p>
    <p>Versatile – Architects love diving into all sorts of challenges.</p>
    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
    <p>Arrogant – Architects might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible.</p>
    <p>Dismissive of Emotions – For Architects, rationality is king.</p>
    <p>Overly Critical – These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings.</p>
    <p>Combative – Architects hate blindly following anything without understanding why.</p>
    <p>Romantically Clueless – Architects’ relentless rationality can lead them to be frustrated by romance.</p>

    <h3>My results</h3>
    <p>My score: 50</p>
    <p>Comment: Your creativity is a "work in progress." You've had some successes, so now it's time to let loose and stretch yourself. Share your ideas and perspectives with others, and ask them how they view problems. Adopt a collaborative approach to problem finding, and work actively with others to create and innovate. The tools and resources below will help you get to the next level of creativity.</p>

    <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
    <p>For me, how relevant the results are is proportional to the reliability and accuracy of the tests themselves. I find that the personality test from 16 Personalities is both reliable and accurate, so to me, it is meaningful. I can learn to be more aware of the way I act, and the way I do things, and be able to more actively work on myself. As for the VARK questionnaire, I find that the results are not as meaningful, not because of the test’s credibility itself, but because of a certain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA" style="display: inline;padding: 0px;color:salmon;font-family: verdana;background-color:rgb(32,32,32);">video</a> that I recall watching from Veritasium. Finally, for the creativity test, I don’t feel that it’s that meaningful to me personally, but it does give me a general idea of my level of creativity.</p>

    <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
    <p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
    From the results, I can get a better Idea of both my strengths and weaknesses, and that can allow me to both optimise teamwork by utilising my strengths, as well as work on my weaknesses. Additionally, knowing the results of other members in my team can also change my behaviour towards them, as I would have a general idea of what their personalities are like. This can benefit teamwork in that social conflicts, such as misunderstandings, can be more easily avoided.</p>

    <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
    <p>When forming a team, I think that a good mix of personalities would be good in developing social skills, but also has a slight risk in bad communication. But for a risk like that, I think that the trade off is beneficial, especially because a mix of personalities can also bring a wider variety of ideas to the table.</p>

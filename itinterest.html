  	<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
    <h2>What is your interst in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
  	<p>I’ve had an interest in IT for as long as I can remember, and I believe that it mainly stemmed from my love of video games at a young age. At the moment, generally all aspects pique my interest, so I’m looking forward to seeing what specific branch will catch my eye. As of now, artificial intelligence has really caught my interest, so I'm looking forward to potentially learning about that in the future. I have gained some experience in networking from the time I spent in national service, as I was assigned to a military unit that maintained networks for the army nationwide, so hopefully I will be able to put that to good use in the future as well.</p>
    <p>One branch of IT that I’m especially interested in right now is artificial intelligence (AI), and it’s probably due to my obsession with automation. I love automating things, especially mundane tasks, so the thought of AI being able to accomplish that for me seems really cool and convenient. One really interesting implementation of machine learning AI is in video games, though. I imagine that in the future when we are able to develop AI that is able to learn more quickly, and take less computing power, that game worlds could be run with AI alongside real players themselves. A development like that would be quite revolutionary, especially for the likes of MMORPG games.</p>
    <p>Another topic that catches my eye is user centered design. I find it both challenging and fun at the same time to produce an interface that is both aesthetic, and functional. Although I have only had some experience with digital interface art, hopefully I can further develop those skills into something that will be beneficial in the future.</p>

        <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
        <p style="padding-right:15px">I chose to study at RMIT for two main reasons. The first reason is that the university campus is in an ideal location for study. Following up with this reason, I intend to settle down and work in Melbourne, so I find it convenient to continue studying here. The other reason is that RMIT provided a good program for IT, and it has many different branches that I can potentially specialise in. I also feel like RMIT has great opportunities to find work after graduating, due to the many gateways provided over the course of the program.</p>

        <h2 style="padding-left:15px">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
      	<p style="padding-left:15px">In my studies, I expect to learn more about the world of IT, and the different branches to specialise in. I especially look forward to expanding my knowledge on networking, as well as learning about artificial intelligence. Hopefully I will also be able to solidify my skills in programming too. By the end of my 3 year studies, I hope to have decided on what I want to specialise in, but also have good general knowledge of all things IT.</p>

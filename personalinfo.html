    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  	<p>Hi, my full name is Zhen Rong Xavier Tan, but most people just call me Xavier. I was born in Singapore, but spent most of my time studying overseas in China, and Australia. I graduated from Year 12 at the end of 2018, and then had to go through 2 years of national service in Singapore. I am currently in my first year of university, studying in Bachelor of Information Technologoy.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was young, I had always taken an interest in both sports and video games, but as time went on, I found video games to be generally more accessable for me to keep up with, since I would move country really often. However, in the past few years, I picked up rock climbing, and it's one of the most enjoyable sports for me right now, and I will definitely continue pursuing the sport for the future to come.</p>
    <p>Apart from video games and rock climbing, I also enjoy watching anime, especially action, and wholesome rom-coms.</p>

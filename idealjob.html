    <h2>Description of the Position & It's Appeal</h2>
    <p>This job advertises a position in assisting the development of machine learning modules and algorithms. Since I am quite interested in artificial intelligence (AI), I find this position to be appealing to me. I think it would be awesome to develop an AI for new modules and algorithms.</p>

    <h2>Description of the Skills, Qualifications, and Experience Required</h2>
    <p>For this particular position, experience with machine learning is required. Additionally, strong skills in python, and stakeholder engagement is also needed. The last thing that is desired is a vision for computers and AI.</p>

    <p>Currently the few skills that I have are basic knowledge in python, java, html, and css. I have dabbled in the field of IT security, as well as networking. So far I have touched the basics of quite a few topics, but am not particularly strong in any one subject.</p>

    <h2>How I will Build up my Current Skills, Qualifications, and Experience</h2>

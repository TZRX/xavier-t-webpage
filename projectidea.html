  	<h1>Project Idea</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>A project idea that I’ve had for a while now is a game/trainer application that will not only serve as a game, but as a typing trainer. Although there are many typing games out there that can allow users to train up their typing speed, I have yet to find a typing game that has rhythm aspects. The general idea of the typing game is that the user will have an overlay similar to that of DDR, with specific keys on the screen, and as the note approaches the key, they have to time their keypress as it reaches the overlay. These notes will approach in time with music playing, and as song difficulty increases, there could be more keys to press.</p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>This project is really interesting to me, not only because I am a huge fan of rhythm games, but also because I like custom keyboards. Combining both typing, and rhythm games seemed like a cool idea, that not only could be fun and have a high skill cap, but would also train people to be able to type quickly. In the present day, almost all forms of work involve typing, and a game like this could be really beneficial to users who want to learn to type quickly, but don’t want to go through the tediousness of having to dump hours into typeracer, or other likes. </p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <img src="images/changing_layout.jpg" alt="layout sketch" style="float:right;max-width:100%;height:auto;">
    <p>The game would mainly be centered around pressing keys to the music. With an overlaid HUD with the relevant keys to press, notes approach in time to the music playing, and are set to reach the overlay to the beat. For easy difficulties, there could be less keys to press, and there is lower note density. For example, an easy difficulty could only have the keys ‘a,s,d,f,,j,k,l’ and the notes would come every other beat. As difficulty gets harder, the variety of keys, as well as the speed and note density could increase, requiring the user to press keys more quickly.</p>
    <p>To increase the focus on actually training users to type quickly, the game could also provide settings that override a particular key overlay, and allow users to choose which specific keys they want on the screen. This allows them to tailor their experience to better target their weaknesses, for example, pressing ‘z’ or ‘p’. Another feature that could help users improve their typing could be a summary after a particular song is played, which could show how many notes they mis-timed, or notes where they hit the wrong key. Adding this summary to a lifetime statistics chart could give an overall idea of which keys the user is weaker at reaching for.</p>
    <p>One of the main issues with a rhythm game like this is music licensing. Taking a page out of the book of a rhythm game called ‘osu!’, they are able to provide an almost infinite number of songs to be played. The way they can do this without proper licensing is that they ensure that they do not profit off the songs that are used, but instead make earnings through donations from the community. A community-driven game like this not only allows for almost any song to be implemented into the game, but also forces the users themselves to map the notes to the beats of the songs, and share them to others, allowing for an abundant flow of playable ‘maps’ as they are called. A similar strategy could be used for this project idea, having the community instead of the developer implement maps from songs of their choosing, and share it around the community to be played. Of course, there would still need to be some base songs from the developer to give users an idea of how the game is played.</p>
    <p>Extending off the idea of the game being community driven, the game could also have a ranking system. This ranking system could be an absolute number, like in ‘osu!’, where you can quite literally be number 1 in the world, or could be grouping based, like in many other popular competitive games, for example, silver, gold, platinum, and so on. The ranking could be based on a scoring system from the difficulty of songs, with scores being higher the more difficult a particular pattern is to execute. It would certainly be interesting to see a high level player be able to type consistently at 200 words per minute to extremely fast songs.</p>
    <p>To accommodate for other languages, an option could even be added to change layouts based on languages. For example the Korean keyboard layout consists of different character components, that when keyed in in a certain order, outputs a character. The game's HUD layout could be changed to display these character components instead of the usual English alphabet. Taking it a step further, with languages that have character phonetics such as ‘ä’ and ‘č’, or in a similar case, special characters such as ‘@’ and ‘!’, can add an extra layer of difficulty, requiring players to make multiple keyboard inputs to register the actual key input in the game.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <p>For a project like this, tools such as Github and Visual Studio Code will definitely be needed. As for the programming language to be used, Python may not be able to fulfil all the requirements due to the nature of it being a rather simple language, so preferably Java or C# could be used instead. Because the game will likely be rendered in 2D, many game resources and sprites could be made in image editing software like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. With technologies as simple as this, the hardware required wouldn't need to be too high end, a computer with moderate specifications would be able to get the job done.</p>

    <h2>Skills Required</h2>
    <p>Using the required technologies as reference, I would definitely need advanced skills in a particular programming language, as well as some skill in basic art. For now, how I see it is that a rough prototype requires working functions (programming skills), and art could be at a minimum. With a working prototype, the project could be pitched to recruit an artist more experienced than I am, which could drop art being a required skill from me.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>If a project like this is successful, I would see a fully functioning typing game, with a robust layout modification system that caters to all difficulty levels, as well as multiple languages. It would also be fun and engaging when paired with music, to keep players coming back just because it’s enjoyable to play. The end goal would be a typing game that allows players to drastically improve their typing speed through the fun of rhythm, but also include a competitive ranking system that can motivate people to push past their limits.</p>
